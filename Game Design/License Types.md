Sure! I'll provide a comparison of these licenses, grouping them by their purpose and characteristics.

1.  **Purpose**:
    
    *   **CC (Creative Commons) licenses** are typically used for creative works, such as art, photography, music, and writings.
    *   **Software licenses** like WTFPL, GPL, LGPL, and MIT are primarily used for software and code.
2.  **License Comparison**:
    
    *   **CC0**:
        *   Also known as "No Rights Reserved."
        *   Allows creators to waive all their copyright and related rights in their works.
        *   In essence, a work under CC0 is as close to being in the public domain as possible.
    *   **WTFPL (Do What The F**\* You Want To Public License)\*\*:
        *   Extremely permissive license for software and other kinds of works.
        *   Very similar in spirit to CC0, giving almost no restrictions.
    
    **CC0 is somewhat equivalent to WTFPL** in terms of permissiveness.
    
    *   **BY (Attribution)**:
        *   Requires attribution to the original creator.
    *   **MIT License**:
        *   Permissive free software license.
        *   Allows for reuse within proprietary software as long as the license is included.
        *   Requires attribution, similar in spirit to BY.
    
    **BY is somewhat analogous to MIT** in terms of requiring attribution.
    
    *   **NC (Non-Commercial)**:
        *   Prohibits commercial use of the work.
    
    **There's no direct equivalent to NC in the typical software licenses mentioned.**
    
    *   **SA (ShareAlike)**:
        *   If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
    *   **GPL (GNU General Public License)**:
        *   Ensures that software is free and that any derivative work remains under the GPL.
        *   Similar in spirit to SA.
    
    **SA is similar to GPL** in terms of the copyleft principle.
    
    *   **ND (NoDerivatives)**:
        *   You can't modify or create derivative works based on the original.
    
    **There's no direct equivalent to ND in the typical software licenses mentioned, as most are meant to allow for modification and derivative works.**
    
    *   **LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License)**:
        *   Similar to the GPL but allows you to link the open-source code to proprietary modules.
    
    **LGPL is a sort of middle ground**, ensuring freedom of the code itself but being more lenient when integrated into larger, potentially proprietary, works.
    

In summary:

*   **CC0 ≈ WTFPL** in permissiveness.
*   **BY ≈ MIT** in requiring attribution.
*   **SA ≈ GPL** in copyleft (i.e., the principle that derivative works must be open-sourced under the same license).

It's important to consult with a legal expert when considering which license to use for a particular work, as this overview is simplified and might not capture all nuances.

Sure! You can find software and resources licensed under the mentioned licenses at the following locations:

### WTFPL or MIT-licensed software:

1.  **GitHub**: Many open-source projects on GitHub are licensed under the MIT License or WTFPL. You can search for projects by license:
    
    *   MIT: [https://github.com/search?q=license%3Amit](https://github.com/search?q=license%3Amit)
    *   WTFPL: [https://github.com/search?q=license%3Awtfpl](https://github.com/search?q=license%3Awtfpl)
2.  **npm**: For JavaScript projects and libraries, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) often hosts packages with these licenses. You can search and then check the license for each package.
    

### CC0 resources:

1.  **Pixabay**: A platform offering free photos, videos, and music:
    
    *   [https://www.pixabay.com/](https://www.pixabay.com/)
2.  **Pexels**: Another platform for free photos and videos:
    
    *   [https://www.pexels.com/](https://www.pexels.com/)
3.  **Public Domain Vectors**: For vector graphics:
    
    *   [https://publicdomainvectors.org/](https://publicdomainvectors.org/)
4.  **CC0 Textures**: Free textures for 3D artists:
    
    *   [https://cc0textures.com/](https://cc0textures.com/)
5.  **Open Game Art**: Some art here is under the CC0 license:
    
    *   [https://opengameart.org/](https://opengameart.org/)
6.  **Creative Commons Search**: Allows you to search for creative commons licensed content. You can filter by the CC0 license:
    
    *   [https://search.creativecommons.org/](https://search.creativecommons.org/)

Remember to always double-check the licensing for each individual asset or software package, as platforms may host a mix of licenses, and terms can change over time.
