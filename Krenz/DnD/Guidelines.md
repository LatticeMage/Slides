## 遊戲劇本注意事項

* 遊戲時長要先規定好
* 數值為主，劇情為輔，遊玩過程是由玩家跟城主去或的劇情


### 起承轉合
Blake Snyder's "Save the Cat!" Beat Sheet in 3 act:
* **Act I:**
    * **Opening Image (1)**: A visual that represents the struggle & tone of the story. A snapshot of the main character's problem, before the adventure begins.</li>
    * **Theme Stated (5)**: Hints at what the story's main message or lesson will be. This can often be a question or a statement made by a character.</li>
    * **Set-Up (1-10)**: Establishes the main character's life as it is now. This segment gives us the status quo of the protagonist.</li>
    * **Catalyst (12)**: An event that sparks the main story or conflict. It's the call to adventure, the thing that disrupts the status quo.</li>
    * **Debate (12-25)**: A period of doubt or questioning. The protagonist wonders, "Should I embark on this journey?"</li>
* **Break Into Act II:**
    * **Break Into Two (25)**: The protagonist makes the decision to embark on the journey. The story is now set in a new direction.</li>
* **Act II:**
    * **B Story (30)**: Introduces a secondary plot or character that serves as a counterpoint to the main A story.</li>
    * **Fun and Games (30-55)**: This is where we see the premise of the movie in full swing. The character faces trials, some of which they might fail, and some they might win.</li>
    * **Midpoint (55)**: A major twist or event that ups the stakes and makes the protagonist's goal harder to achieve.</li>
    * **Bad Guys Close In (55-75)**: Obstacles become more frequent and harder. The antagonist forces apply pressure on the protagonist.</li>
    * **All Is Lost (75)**: The low point of the narrative. It seems like the protagonist has lost everything and their goal is unattainable.</li>
    * **Dark Night of the Soul (75-85)**: A moment of reflection and despair. The protagonist must decide whether to continue the fight or to give up.</li>
* **Break Into Act III:**
    * **Break Into Three (85)**: Renewed determination and hope. The protagonist decides to try once more, often with a new plan.</li>
* **Act III:**
    * **Finale (85-110)**: Climactic sequence. The protagonist confronts the antagonist or the main obstacle, leading to a resolution.</li>
    * **Final Image (110)**: A mirror to the opening image, showcasing how much has changed and how the protagonist has transformed.</li>
