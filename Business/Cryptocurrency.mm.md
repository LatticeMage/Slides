## Topics
- Example
  - Transaction Fees: Taker: 0.04% Maker: 0.02%
  - Strategy Win Rate: 55%
    - Starting Capital: $100 Leveraged 10 times = $1000
      - Assumed Profit: +2x10% -2x10%
      - Average over 10 times:
      - Average Profit: 20 - (0.04% * 1000 * 10 * 2) = 12
      - Assumed Monthly ROI: 12%
      - Catch: This 12% after leveraging equates to a monthly return of 1.2%, which is similar to stocks.
    - Starting Capital: 25 Leverage 40 times = 1000
      - Profit: +2x40% -2x40%
    - Starting Capital: 20 Leverage 50 times = 1000
      - Profit: +2x50% -2x50%
      - Note: If a margin call occurs, additional transaction fees are applied.

- Risk Management
  - Poker
    - NL2: 20 buy-ins, Starting Capital 40.
    - If promoted successfully, the balance becomes 100.
    - NL5: 20 buy-ins, Starting Capital 100.
    - If promoted successfully, the balance becomes 200.
    - NL10: 20 buy-ins, Starting Capital 200.
    - If you lose significantly and drop to a little over 100, you'll need to downgrade. 
    - This maintains the same ROI over a long period.

- Other Topics
  - Asymmetry in Profits and Losses
    - If you lose 10% from 100, you're left with 90.
    - But to get back to 100 from 90, you need to earn 11%.
    - If you lose 50% from 100, you're left with 50.
    - But to get back to 100 from 50, you need to earn 100%.
    - **Larger leverage actually makes it easy to face volatility that eats up the principal, making upgrades difficult.**
